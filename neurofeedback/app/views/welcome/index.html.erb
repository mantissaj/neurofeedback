			<ol> 
				<li> We will first schedule a private consultation to assess, test, chart, agree and outline your individualized training protocol. </li>
				<li> We will follow with a set of regularly scheduled appointments. The best results occur when there has been sufficient training sessions to maintain long term effects (see Journal of Pediatrics study, February 17, 2014). Sessions are scheduled for two to three times a week and are completed within an hour. The average time to complete training is two to three months.</li>
				<li> Finally, we will reassess, test, chart, discuss and evaluate results. Results are both qualitative and quantitative. Comparing the test results from the end of your training with the initial testing will allow for a quantitiative analysis of progress. </li>

	<h3> 1.	What is Neurofeedback? </h3>
<%= image_tag "neuronsignaling.jpg", id: "neuronsignaling" %>
<p> Neurofeedback is a non-invasive, non-medicated and long term treatment for ADHD, PTSD, sleep, self regulation and more. </p>
 
<p>Links to primary articles showing the effectiveness of Neurofeedback in treating pain, addiction, autism, depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, headaches, insomnia, Tourette syndrome and brain damage from strokes or trauma can be found

	<blockquote>"In my opinion, if any medication had demonstrated such a wide spectrum of efficacy [as neurofeedback], it would be universally accepted and widely used" 
	<br>

 	Clinical EEG and Neuroscience, January 2000. </span>

<br>
	
	<h3> 2.	How is Neurofeedback done?</h3>

<%= image_tag "Brain_Waves.jpg", id: "brainwaves" %>
<p>Brainwave activity is measured with an electro-encephalograph (EEG). The EEG equipment is connected to the individual with sensors that are attached on the scalp and ears. The sensors are safe, do not prick the skin and are painless. There is no application of any voltage or current to the brain. It’s entirely non-invasive. Clients are taught to play movies or computerized games using their brainwave activity. Changes in client brainwave activity are fed back to the individual through visual and/or auditory, sensory information by the computer.  </p>

Neurofeedback Board Certified </span> - BCIA.org 



<br>
 BA Psychology, & Dance Educator (State of NM Licensed Teacher pre K-12 Performing Arts Teaching and Physical Eduction). 
<br> <br>
<p>As a Board Certified Neurofeedback Coach with five years’ experience providing neurofeedback services to address emotional, learning, performance skills and stress-related concerns, I am confident of my ability to make a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of my clients, 
With an extensive background and education in dance and performing arts, I have seen first-hand how the mind and body can train together to enhance health while increasing confidence and aiding self-realization. This experience compelled me to pursue the burgeoning field of neurofeedback, which has been proven to greatly improve brain function and treat a wide range of issues, including brain dysregulations, sleep disturbances, and learning disorders in addition to serving as an affordable way to optimize cognitive functioning (concentration, flexibility, & memory) and upgrade athletic performance. I offer proven expertise assessing client needs and goals, developing and administering neurofeedback training plans, documenting and analyzing progress, and adjusting neurofeedback protocols to improve training effectiveness. I would be pleased to continue my record of success as your next Neurofeedback Coach.</p>

		<h1>Testimonials</h1>
		
		"Ms. Johnston helped our 6 year-old son regulate his emotions by focusing his attention and relaxing his body. He learned how to lower his anxiety (i.e., went to school without melting down) and learned how to redirect his anger (i.e., telling us he was angry versus immediately acting out). I think we're continuing to learn how to be less reactive as a family, verbalize what our needs are, breathe and relax. In addition, Ms. Johnston is an experienced teacher so she wasn't intimidated by our son's intensity (and charm-optional). I highly recommend Ms. Johnston and BrainWorks Neurofeedback!"
